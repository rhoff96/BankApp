# Welcome to the CLI Banking App!

This program is designed to simulate the operations of a typical banking app. Its features include authenticating users, adding multiple accounts and account types per user, and providing withdrawal, deposit, and transfer functionality.
Additionally, it mimics some typical banking policies such as overdraft fees on transactions that fall below a minimum required balance, and a limit on the number of withdrawals per session from a savings account.

I really enjoyed the process of building functionality onto a project that essentially started as a simple calculator. It was really exciting to see this program start to resemble a more sophisticated banking application over a relatively short time.


I began development of the project in Week 1 of the Tech Elevator Software Development bootcamp, and added more functionality as the program progressed through Week 3. Some of these evolving features included:

-Creating Collections to hold user data

-Employing BigDecimal to make accurate financial calculations

-Using the pillars of OOP to organize the program into classes

-Using inheritance to represent savings and checking accounts

-Method Overriding to provide unique functionality for savings accounts, printing string representations of objects, and evaluating object equality

-Designing program workflow using dependency injections

-Maintaining separation of concerns

-Developing Unit Tests to improve the revision and refactoring process

-Validating user input

-Handling exceptions

-Using File I/O to store transactions in a log

In addition to the concepts covered during these first weeks, I researched regular expressions in order to more easily validate user input.



Please note that a few lines of sample user data are hard coded into the current program in order to test the functionality that depends on persistent data.

I intend to build this program out further to store data in a database, and eventually create a front end beyond the CLI. Additional features that I hope to incorporate include transfers between users, creating unique savings account interest based on account balance tiers, and a social feed of transactions.
